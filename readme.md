# Contract financial performance modelling

### **NEM Review contract co-design workshop**

## Initial modelling approach

### Data profiles

* All contract parties – suppliers and buyers – are in the South Australian market
* Generation and price profiles are based on historic SA data (5 years of data: 2020 to 2024)
* Suppliers include:
  - **Existing wind**: All existing large-scale SA wind stations that have been generating since 2020, scaled to 250 MW
  - **Existing solar**: All existing large-scale SA solar stations that have been generating since 2020, scaled to 250 MW
  - **Existing wind-solar hybrid**: Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park profile, scaled to 250 MW each of wind/solar

## Potential modelling updates

* Incorporate hydrid stations: 
  - **Wind-battery hydrid**: A hypothetical station with wind profile based on Hornsdale 3, scaled to 250 MW with 100 MW (200 MWh) battery
  - **Solar-battery hydrid**: A hypothetical station wind profile based on Bungala 2, scaled to 250 MW with 100 MW (200 MWh) battery
* Hybrid stations' battery behaviour will be based on heuristics, prioritising defence of the station's contract position
* Incorporate seasonal generation data from AEMO's Generation Information, with contracts tailed to varying maximum capacities 
* Expand modelling to all NEM regions
* Synthesise generation and price data to test contracts against a wider range of outcomes
